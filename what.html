      <p>  On Western Mythology: </p>
    <p>    “Christian individuation did not result in a return flow of history, a cyclical renewal; on the contrary, by universalizing linear time ---before and after Christ---it brought a chronology pf the human race into general use, initiating a History of Humanity.” pg 48, Poetics of Relation
</p>
  <p>      “...the generalization inspired by Christ was picked up by Darwin’s generalizing theory... Both were concerned with transcending the old mythical filiation linked to the destiny of a community, to go beyond this with a universalizing notion that would retain, however, the power of the principle of linearity and that “grasped” and justified History.” pg 49, Poetics of Relation

    <p>This exhibition programme aims to engage its audience with a reevaluation of gloss, a term alluding to gaudiness and superficiality, as a way of disrupting the temporalities that are innate in existing power structures. This project will consist of a week-long exhibition, an on-site events programme with screenings, and a small accompanying publication. Lending from Anna Greenspan’s Shanghai Future: Modernity Remade and e-flux’s Politics of Shine along with other works, this exhibition programme re-examines gloss as a tool for subversion and explores its ability to disrupt and open up new temporalities.</p>

    <p>Inspired by a careful study of the history of time in its many philosophical, scientific and practical manifestations, towards its present incarnation as Western, anthropocentric and capitalocentric, laden with ideas of progression, forward movement, causal relations and unforgiving linearity, we hope to instead reflect (pun intended) on the value of gloss as a subversive device for a subaltern class. We ask what might happen if gloss, with its ability to dazzle, to varnish and preserve or to cover up decay, progress, and history, is weaponised in the face of unceasing Western time. What new temporal modes might surface on its lustrous skin, what simmering unrest is it concealing?</p>

    <p>We are looking for artworks in any medium, 2D, 3D, time-based, digital or performance, that respond to these themes.</p>
